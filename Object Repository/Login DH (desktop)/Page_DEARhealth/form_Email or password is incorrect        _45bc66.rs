    Terms and Conditions of Use 


    UCLA eIBD


    
    The UCLA Center for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases is pleased to offer their patients the ability to view their medical information and interact with the UCLA
    Center for IBD offices online by using the UCLA eIBD website. This website and related services are subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set
    forth below. Please read the following information carefully. 


    If you think you have a medical or psychiatric emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest hospital. 


    
        By using UCLA eIBD, you signify your agreement to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you are not able to
        use UCLA eIBD.
    


    Terms and Conditions 


    The information provided on UCLA eIBD is not a substitute for the advice of a personal physician or other qualified healthcare professional. Always seek
    the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare professional with any questions you may have regarding medical symptoms or a medical condition.
    Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on UCLA eIBD.


    If you think you have a non-urgent medical matter, call your health care provider’s office.


    2. Electronic Communications


    All communications between you and your UCLA Health, UCLA Center for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) team using UCLA eIBD are carried over a secure,
    encrypted connection directly into the UCLA eIBD system. While you may receive internet e-mail messages notifying you of new messages in your UCLA eIBD
    Inbox, these e-mails will not contain any confidential medical information.


    Messages that you send via UCLA eIBD may become part of your permanent legal medical record at the discretion of the UCLA Health care provider or support
    staff. Once a message is made part of your permanent medical record, it will be accessible to current and future UCLA Health health care provider(s) and
    staff members at UCLA Health who are appropriately involved in your care.


    Your health care provider may choose to select an associate(s) to help manage and respond to your electronic messages on UCLA eIBD. These may include
    nursing or other administrative staff who review messages sent via UCLA eIBD and either respond or route the message to the health care provider. Use of
    UCLA eIBD secure messaging may not be appropriate if the message includes sensitive information that you would only wish to discuss directly with your
    provider.


    UCLA Center for IBD will make its best effort to provide a timely response to electronic inquiries or other communication submitted through UCLA eIBD. In
    some cases, the UCLA Center for IBD staff may not be immediately available, so you should allow at least two (2) business days for a response. Emergency
    matters requiring immediate attention should not be submitted through UCLA eIBD.


    With respect to any electronic communications sent through UCLA eIBD, UCLA Center for IBD is only able to respond to such communications based on the
    information provided by the patient. If insufficient information is provided, UCLA Health will be unable to provide accurate and reliable services.


    3. Eligibility to Use UCLA eIBD


    Two requirements must be met for a patient to be eligible to use UCLA eIBD. First, a patient must be eighteen (18) years of age or older. A minor may not
    establish a UCLA eIBD account. Second, a patient must be an active patient of UCLA Health, UCLA Center for IBD.


    4. User Participation in UCLA eIBD


    Although UCLA eIBD displays certain information from your health record, it does not necessarily display all information found in your medical record. If
    you think that your health information displayed in UCLA eIBD is inaccurate, you can request that the UCLA Center for IBD amend your UCLA eIBD by messaging
    your provider(s) within UCLA eIBD.


    To request a complete copy of your medical records, please contact: Health Information Management Services (HIMS) at (310) 825-6021.

    misappropriate or violate any rights of any party. In consideration of being allowed to use UCLA eIBD, you agree that the following actions shall
